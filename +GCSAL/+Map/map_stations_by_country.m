% countries_with_station = map_stations_by_country(all_stations, countries_data)
%   For each country in countries_data, finds stations in all_stations that
%   are within the borders of the country based on the latitude and
%   longitude of the stations and countries.
%
%   Returns a struct array countries where each element contains the
%   country name and a list of stations ids that were found to be contained
%   by that country.
%
%   If countries_data is not input, then the function will try to load
%   countries_data from ne_110m_admin_0_countries.mat if the file exists on
%   the path
%
% INPUTS
%     all_stations - struct array, each element should contain lat and long
%                    of the station in degrees and id for the identifier of
%                    the station
%   countries_data - struct array, each element should contain Lat and Lon of
%                    the borders of the country in degrees as well as name to
%                    identify the country
%
% OUTPUTS
%    countries - struct array, each element contains name, Lat, Lon, and
%                stations. name is a string. Lat and Lon are the borders
%                of the country in degrees. stations is a string matrix
%                with each row an id for a station contained in that
%                country.
